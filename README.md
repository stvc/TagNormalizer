TagNormalizer
=============
A simple android app which scans a given directory to find ID3 tag
discrepancies in music files in common directories. These discrepancies cause
many music players categorizing tracks with the same "album" tag into seperate
albums. This app scans your music library for such problems and fixes them for
you.

Building
--------
This app requires the [Jaudiotagger](http://www.jthink.net/jaudiotagger/)
library, and has been tested with version 2.0.4.
